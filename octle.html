        &nbsp; <h2>LIVE IN THE PRESENT!</h2>
        &nbsp; <p>Like they say;<strong>"Yesterday's the past, tomorrow's the future,but today is a gift. 
            &nbsp; That's why it's called the present."</strong></p>
            <figure>

           <figcaption>The Most Wonderful Gift from God.</figcaption>
            </figure>
        Human beings are more worried about the things of the past or the future rather than living <br>
        life like it goes.We are here in this world for only a short period of time and we don't even<br>
        get time to live it completely! That's why most of us die in a guilt of not fulfilling our <br>
        dreams.When we think about a bad incident that happened in the past,we are actually living<br>
        that mood twice!Why rather not create a pleasant memory now?Things of the past does not define<br>
        the way we are today....but what you do today is gonna make an impact on the way the world sees<br>
        you tomorrow.So erase those bad influences of the past, learn from your mistakes, cut off ties<br>
        with people you dont feel good to be around. This will polish you to face the future.<br>

        &nbsp;<h2>EVERYONE DESERVES TO BE RESPECTED.</h2>
        &nbsp;<p><strong>"When we show our respect for other living things, they respond with respect for us."</strong></p>

        <figcaption>We are all the Same</figcaption>
        </figure>
        &nbsp; No one is born, nor raised to live a left out life from the society. Even if it is a poor vagabond, or a rich<br>
    businessman.Everyone deserves respect. Human behaviour is so strange that we believe we have developed a lot<br>
    from the past, but reality is just worse! We are forced to be in this judgemental society where people of one<br>
    kind is treated different from the others.It's so pathetic that we don't realise where we all come from! We <br>
    are all the same type of flowers in the same garden of love, happiness, brotherhood and peace.Remember the rule<br>
    of Karma...<em>WHAT GOES AROUND,COMES AROUND.</em>

        </figure>
        &nbsp; <P><strong>"There is no room for regrets in this world if there are no rooms of differences."</strong></P>
        &nbsp;  Have you been in a situation where you reacted in a manner you regretted? Probably yes! Right? It's ok...<br>
    we all learn from mistakes. We might have hurt someone with our words or actions, about which we spend sleepless<br>
    nights regretting! But once you understand the rule of the world, you are free from this guilt. We have two ears<br>
    and one mouth for a reason; to hear as twice as much as you talk! Our words must be chosen wisely 'cause <br>
    <em>once anything is said,it can't be taken back!</em>

        &nbsp; Life is short. Life is precious!We are here for a purpose. We must fulfill it by loving everyone.We don't know how long<br>
    we will be alive for it's short and unpredictable.So as long as we are here, make sure you live it great.<br>
    Always Remember:
    <ul>
        <li>Life is a beautiful, miraculous gift that needs to be savored</li>
        <li>Gratitude is the pathway to hope</li>
        <li> There is a reason for every failure we experience in life</li>
        <li>Pain makes us stronger and more aware</li>
        <li>We’re here today, but we can be gone tomorrow so live life to the fullest</li>
        <li>All of us are on unique journeys in life and we shouldn’t compare ourselves to others</li>
    </ul>
    &nbsp; Remove all negativity and hate from your life, and forgive those around you for whatever it is they might have wronged you for.<br>
    You don’t need to forget. Just forgive. It will lighten the load and make you further appreciate the fragility of life.<br>

        &nbsp;Before blasting out at someone, before critisizing someone, before hating someone for literally no reason, or before wishing bad<br> 
    for someone because they were not being the way you expected them to be;<strong>STOP!</strong> What if that person is no more the<br>
    very next day? Can you go back in time to change things as it happened?NO! You will live in the haunting memory of that person.<br> 
    So be good to all...and get the good from the world.You don't know what would happen to anyone the very next second! So keep this<br> 
    bitter truth of life in mind<em> DEATH.</em>
